We can apply validation for certain types of text entries. For example, we can make sure that a phone number or email address is correctly formatted.

{% capture postcode %}

1. Click `Add field`.
2. Choose `Text box`.
3. Type Postcode in the `Field` Label and type *postcode* in the `Variable Name`.
4. In the `Validation` field, select *Postal code (Australia)*. This will ensure only four numerals can be entered into the field.
5. In the `Field` note field, type *“Providing your postcode is optional. We collect approximate residency data to assist with interpreting trial results.”*
6. Click `Save`.
{% endcapture %}

{% capture email %}

2. Choose `Text box`.
3. Type *Email* in the `Field` Label and type *email* in the `Variable Name`.

### Validating dates

### Validating numbers

{% capture heightweight %}

1. Create two new text box fields:  for Height (cm) (Variable Name: **height_cm**) and Weight (Kg) (Variable Name: **weight_kg**) using the instructions above.
