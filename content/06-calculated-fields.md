You can use calculated fields to determine values based on the values of previous fields. Here we will determine the participant’s age and body mass index (BMI) based on their date of birth and their height and weight.

{% include alert.html text="Calculated fields cannot be tested until the survey is published. " color="warning" %}

{% capture age %}

1. Click `Add field`.
2. Choose *Calculated Field* for the `Field Type`.
3. In the `Field Label`, type Y_our age at the start of this project_.
4. In the `Variable Name`, type **age_at_start**.
5. In the `Calculation Equation`, type: `datediff([dob],"2020-01-01","y")`

{% include alert.html text="REDCap understands terms like ‘now’ and ‘today’, but they are not recommended for calculating age because they will lead to variation in values over time. This is why we select a set date such as January 1 or the project start date." color="info" %}
{% endcapture %}
{% include card.html header="Calculate the participant’s age" text=age %}

{% capture bmi %}
Here, we are going to use the 'height' and 'weight' values provided by the user to calculate their body mass index (BMI).

1. Click `Add field`.
2. Choose `Calculated Field` for the `Field Type`.
3. In the `Field Label`, type Your Body Mass Index (BMI).
4. In the `Variable Name`, type bmi.
5. In the `Calculation Equation`, type: `[weight]*10000/([height]*[height])`.

REDCap understands many calculation functions you might be familiar with from Excel, including IF() statements.
