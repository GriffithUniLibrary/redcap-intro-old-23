description: Before you can create forms and surveys in REDCap, you need to create a project.

## The New Project screen

When you click `New Project` in the top menu, you'll be presented with the` New Project` screen. You can give your project any title that makes sense to you — your project name won't be visible to external participants. You can choose the `purpose` of your project here. Setting a purpose has no effect on the operation of the project. If you set it to 'Research', you have the option of adding some information about the type of study you are doing. We will just set the `purpose` to 'Practice / Just for fun'.

You can start with an empty project, or use a template provided by REDCap. Templates can be a useful way of getting started with a basic project structure, if you know the type of project you need. We are going to start with an empty project.

## Before we proceed: some terminology

Before you start building your project, it will be helpful to understand the terms that REDCap uses. The first and most important distinction is between `instruments`, `forms` and `surveys`.

{% capture instrumentinfo %}

REDCap considers anything that can capture data to be an `instrument`. Data can then be added to an instrument using either `forms` or `surveys`.

{% endcapture %}
{% include alert.html text=instrumentinfo color="info" %}

### Instruments

Think of an instrument as a collection of `fields` (e.g. name, age, etc). You can have any number of instruments in your project. For example, you might want to create one instrument for collecting participants' demographic information, and another instrument for collecting participants' current health indicators (it will become clear later why you might want to separate them).

### Forms

Whenever an instrument is created, a form is made available for the researcher to enter data into. 

Forms and surveys look identical in the `Designer` page. The only difference is that forms are filled out by you the researcher, while surveys are filled out by your participants. Provided surveys have been enabled for your project, you can turn any form into a survey. 

### Surveys

If you want to capture data for your project by asking participants to fill out surveys, you need to enable surveys in your project. If you forget to do this, you won't be able to make your data collection instruments visible to the public (see the section on [distribution](09-distribution.md)). In the

## Choosing an instrument design

It can be helpful to break your data collection into separate instruments. For example, you may only need to collect demographic data from your participants once, whereas you might wish to collect health data from them several times. Alternatively, you might want to present participants with different instruments based on their responses to demographic questions.

Here, we're going to create two instruments: one for *Demographic questions*, and one to collect *Baseline Health Data*.

{% include alert.html text="Click on an activity title to expand it" color="info" %}

{% capture renameinstrument %}

1. Under `Project Home and Design`, click `Designer`
2. Under `Data Collection Instruments`, you'll see one instrument in the list, called *My First Instrument*.
3. Click on `Choose actions` under `Instrument actions` and select `Rename`.
4. Name the instrument *Demographic data*.
{% endcapture %}

{% capture baseline %}

1. Click `Create` a new instrument from scratch.
2. Click `Add instrument here`
3. Name your instrument *Baseline Health Data*.
{% endcapture %}
