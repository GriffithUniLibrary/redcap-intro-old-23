## What support is available

This workshop should be enough to get your started, but there is no doubt you will have questions as you go. Here are your sources of help, in the order you should access them: 

1.	The REDCap help pages found under Help & FAQ in the left-hand navigation or from the top of the My Projects page. 
2.	Griffith Library's [Working with Data](https://www.griffith.edu.au/library/research-publishing/working-with-data/create-and-capture) pages | these contains general information about capturing research data and about our survey tools and techniques.
3.	Ask us for help directly via https://intranet.secure.griffith.edu.au/library/forms/help
